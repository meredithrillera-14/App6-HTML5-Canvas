Brief Description of Goal of Code:
To create a canvas that displays a rectangle, text, and an image. When the user clicks a button corresponding to that specific function. Also, present on the canvas is a button with the ability to clear the entire canvas. 
 
Known Issues:
The text, image, and clearing the board does not work, meaning the buttons linked with them also do not work. Still not sure if the canvas and rectangleare the same thing. I think the problem is that the rectangle is constantly on the canvas, not allowing room for the other functions to work.
